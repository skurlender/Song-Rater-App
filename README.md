## then,
- React requires node.js and its package manager npm.
  install NPM with `npm install`.

  In case of a `React Native Expo - Node.js version xxx is no longer supported` error message, you can run `sudo npm install -g n` and `sudo n latest`. `-g` stands for global, i.e., every users on your computer.

- We will be using the Expo CLI development environment. Install the expo command line tools with `npm install -g expo-cli`, where npm is the JavaScript packet manager (you could also use yarn if you wish to).
